churn prediction in telecom industries

OVERVIEW

FEATURES

Data Preprocessing: 

The project includes robust data cleaning and preprocessing steps. It addresses missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical features to prepare the dataset for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 

Gain insights into the telecom dataset through exploratory data analysis. Visualize key trends, patterns, and correlations to better understand factors influencing customer churn.

Logistic Regression Model: 

Implement a logistic regression model to predict customer churn. This model leverages historical customer data to make predictions based on various features.

Model Evaluation: 

Evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This step provides a comprehensive understanding of how well the model generalizes to new data.

Visualization: 

Visualize key insights and results using matplotlib and seaborn. This enhances interpretability and aids in communicating findings to stakeholders.
